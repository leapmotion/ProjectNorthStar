# Project North Star

## Welcome to the [Community Built Documentation](https://project-north-star.gitbook.io/project-north-star/) for Project North Star!

> _We envision a future where the physical and virtual worlds blends together into a single magical experience. At the heart of this experience is hand tracking, which unlocks interactions uniquely suited to virtual and augmented reality._ \
> __\
> _To explore the boundaries of interactive design in AR, we created and open sourced Project North Star, which drove us to push beyond the limitations of existing systems."_\

Project North __ Star is an open-source Augmented Reality headset originally designed by LeapMotion (now UltraLeap) in June 2018. The project has had many variations since its inception, by both UltraLeap and the open-source community. Some of the variations are documented and linked to here but visit the discord server for more to-the-moment information. The headset is almost entirely 3D printable, with a handful of components like reflectors, circuit boards, cables, sensors, and screws that need to be sourced separately.&#x20;

## Variations

Project Northstar has seen its fair share of revisions and updates since the original open-source files were released. To clear up any ambiguity from the outset, **Release 1** was an internal release. **Release 2**, the first public open-source release (sometimes referred to as the **initial release**), was in 2018. **Release 3** came in 2019 and improved on the mechanical design in many ways. As shown from the table below, the newly released **Deck X** is probably what new users will want to start with. It uses an integrated circuit board to reduce cables from the headset to just two, (USB 3 /mini DP), by combining USB devices into a custom-built USB hub + Arduino module.&#x20;
