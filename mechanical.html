<h3>Overview</h3>

The headset is made up of three modular assemblies: the optics bracket, the headgear with hinges, and the halo (which contains all the electronics). This configuration has been very useful as we iterated on different parts. The parts are 3D printed using consumer grade 3D printers and materials, with a couple parts from <a href="https://www.mcmaster.com/">McMaster-Carr</a>. The goal is to have an easily reproduced AR headset that anyone can put together.<br/><br/>

Ignoring the reflectors*, you'll need to 3D print roughly 20+ hours of parts and cut, drill and tap aluminum bar stock. Nothing expensive or major requiring a machine shop, but a few tools are expected. Read below for the list.

<i>*Note: We are exploring different possibilities for individuals to obtain reflectors.</i>

Reflectors (aka combiners, lenses)<br/><br/>

What may seem intimidating at first is conceptually very simple. One property of elipsoids is that all the light emitted from one focus reflects off its surface and focuses it to the second focus! Amazing. Therefore, to figure out the section of elipsoid needed in our AR application, we traced a ray backwards from the second focus, through a cellphone-sized display. <br/><br/> 

The resultant elipsoid is defined by the following dimensions, chosen to allow a range of 3-to-5-inch LCD panels to be placed near the eye. The perimeter of the elipsoid section was decided on empirically by minimizing distortion with a larger prototype, then cropping to the reflected image. This large reflector was roughly 120x120mm, and the final ended up being around 75x75mm.<br/>
<img minimal-lightbox src="imgs/ElipsoidReflector.png"/><img minimal-lightbox src="imgs/reflectorDimensions.png"/><br/><br/>

The reflectors are diamond-turned and milled from PMMA (a.k.a. acrylic). The outside surface needs an anti-reflective coating to prevent a secondary reflection from degrading the image. Indoors and subjectively, 50-50% (transmissive-reflective) anti-reflective coating provided the best results for us.<br/>
<img minimal-lightbox src="imgs/reflectorOverview.png"/><br/><br/>

From the elipsoid definition, the reflectors need to be rotated and translated into position. We define the origin point as the midpoint between the two reflector foci, which should line up with the user's pupils:<br/><br/>

OEM Headgear replacement<br/><br/>

Light and adjustable with rigid mount points. Several welder's mask headgear vendors were tested, but most failed to be rigid or comfortable for our applications. Their general design is made of injection-molded plastic features that tighten onto either side of a welding faceshield. Although it may be desireable for those features to be flexible and compliant for welding, our heavier AR assemblies caused the headgear to flex and/or dig into the users' head. Ouch. The following Miller branded model's had very little flex and generally comfortable. It really helps they're lightweight as well.<br/><br/>

These two specific generations of headgears yielded the best results quickly, mounting evolving electronics on the most varied heads. The amount of adjustment points makes it work for the large majority of users.<br/><br/>

<b>Alternative: </b> <br/><br/>

The 3M Speedglas Utility headgear was the first headgear we used for North Star prototypes. At the time, the optics would bounce around, causing the reflected image to shake wildly as we moved around.  We minimized this by switching to the stiffer Miller headgear and continued other improvements for several months. However, the 3M headgear was sorely missed, as it was simple to put-on and less intimidating for demos. Since then we added cheek alignment features, which solved the image bounce, and therefore makes sense to bring back this design as a supplement to the release headgear. The headgear and optics are interchangeable, only the hinges need to match the headgear.<br/></br>

	Cost and speed being the most important design parameters, this DIY method performs as well as a machined part at 100x lower price. Without access to a CNC metal workshop it's surprisingly expensive to have 1-2 parts machined.<br/><br/>

<h3>Assembly Steps</h3>
<p>The NorthStar headset has three main sub-assemblies: the optics bracket, the electronics tray, and the adjustable headgear.</p>



<strong>Miller headgear:</strong> <i>(see below for alternate headgear with torsion hinge)</i><br/><br/>
1) Verify the aluminum bar stock slides without resistance inside the 3D printed hinges. Tip: Repeatedly sliding the bar stock quickly through a new hinge clears out any obtrusive burs, and the heat generated shapes the plastic.<br/>
2) Disassemble old hinges from headgear, set aside the o-rings:<br/>
<img minimal-lightbox src="imgs/IMG_6541.JPG" />
<img minimal-lightbox src="imgs/IMG_6539.JPG" /><br/><br/>

3) Assemble new hinge as shown below, using screw/nut <span class="BOMRef">H</span>. Tighten until the o-ring is still visible and the hinge has considerable resistance turning.<br/>
4) Slide hinge onto headgear, aligning with front of track. Lock in place using screw <span class="BOMRef">F</span><br/>
<img minimal-lightbox src="imgs/IMG_6542.JPG" />
<img minimal-lightbox src="imgs/IMG_6550.JPG" /><br/><br/>


<!-- > ------------------------- !-->

<i>Alternate: </i> <strong>3M Speedglas headgear:</strong> <br/><br/>

1) Remove the mounting assemblies on both sides of the headgear, enlarge hole to 18mm. We used a stepped drill to enlarge the hole, a little larger than the diameter of the spring we’re using.<br/>
2) Place matching spring into rear housing, fasten close, and trim spring legs.<br/>
<img minimal-lightbox src="imgs/IMG_6758.jpg" />
<img minimal-lightbox src="imgs/IMG_6759.jpg" />
<img minimal-lightbox src="imgs/IMG_6762.jpg" />
<br/><br/>

3) Place the outer hinge housing onto the spring, in the orientation shown.  Using the perimeter fasteners, clamp down onto the spring leg, aligning it with the cutout.<br/>
4) Fasten the large center locknut and screw, adjusting it for the desired resistance. Trim the remaining spring leg.<br/>

<img minimal-lightbox src="imgs/IMG_6764.jpg" />
<img minimal-lightbox src="imgs/IMG_6766.jpg" />
<br/><br/>


<strong>Electronics Tray:</strong><br/><br/>

5) Fasten display driver <span class="BOMRef">B</span> to 3D printed bracket using <span class="BOMRef">F</span> screws x 3. Fasten hand tracking module <span class="BOMRef">A</span> to 3D print using screws from its enclosure<br/>
<img minimal-lightbox src="imgs/IMG_5446.JPG" />
<img minimal-lightbox src="imgs/IMG_5873.JPG" /><br/><br/>

6) Place USB cable into USB strain relief, and fasten using <span class="BOMRef">F</span> screws x 2 to electronics tray<br/>
7) Adjust USB cable until the flex connector is aligned with connector and doesn't strain <br/>
<img minimal-lightbox src="imgs/IMG_7105.JPG" />

<img minimal-lightbox src="imgs/IMG_8951.JPG" /><br/><br/>

Optics Bracket:<br/><br/>

8) Fasten electronics tray to halo using 2 screws <span class="BOMRef">F</span><br/>
9) Fasten optics bracket to the halo using 6 screws <span class="BOMRef">F</span><br/>
<img src="imgs/IMG_1653.JPG"/><br/><br/>

10) Fasten displays and facial interfaces into optics bracket using 4 screws per side <span class="BOMRef">G</span> (8 total). <br/>
11) Carefully connect the display flex connector to the driver board <br/>
<img src="imgs/IMG_6573.jpg"/><img src="imgs/IMG_8165.JPG"/><img src="IMG_1849.JPG"/><br/><br/>

12) Fasten lid to halo using 4 screws <span class="BOMRef">F</span> from the bottom as shown<br/>
13) Secure wires to lid using cable-ties through the anchors<br/>
<img src="imgs/IMG_1849.JPG"/><img src="imgs/IMG_1981.JPG"/><br/><br/>

14) Verify reflectors align with tabs in optics bracket, scrape away offending plastic if not. Using hot-glue, "tack" the reflectors into the halo bracket. Be careful not to use too much and be quick enough that the glue doesn't solidify before the reflectors are in place.<br/><br/>
<img src="imgs/IMG_6585.jpg"/><br/><br/>
Final Assembly:<br/><br/>

15) Fasten slides to assembled optics bracket using 4 x <span class="BOMRef">G</span> screws <br/>

<img src="imgs/IMG_7997.JPG"/><br/><br/>

16) Make adjustments for user's head.
