# Project North Star : Hardware 

This folder contains the mechanical assets necessary to build a Project North Star AR Headset.

## ***WARNING:*** 

Work in Progress. This isn't a finished guide, nor end-user friendly. Major components are missing. Assembly requires care and patience. The build will be fragile and finicky to make work. Nothing worth having is ever easy!
