# Code of Conduct

A primary goal of Project NorthStar is to think and work in collaboration, so we can transcend the potential of each of us, and others. We aim to be inclusive to the largest number of contributors, with the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible. We are committed to providing a friendly, safe, and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, skills and education, ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and religion (or lack thereof). \
\
\
This Code of Conduct outlines our expectations for all those who participate in our community, as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior. We invite all those to help us create safe and positive experiences for everyone, and we also include ways for our attendees to report any violations. Together we can make a fun, harassment-free, magical experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion.

A supplemental goal of this Code of Conduct is to increase open \[source/culture/tech] citizenship by encouraging participants to recognize and strengthen the relationships between our actions and their effects on our community. Communities mirror the societies in which they exist, and positive action is essential to counteract the many forms of inequality and abuses of power that exist in society. If you see someone who is making an extra effort to ensure our community is welcoming, friendly, and encourages all participants to contribute to the fullest extent, we want to know..

Unacceptable behavior from any community member, including sponsors and those with decision-making authority, will not be tolerated.\
